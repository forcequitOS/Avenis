# Avenis
A dead simple SwiftUI project to verify internet connectivity and see your IP addresses, across (MOSTLY, sorry tvOS, you might be able to come back later) appleOS '23 and later, coming soon, for real this time. I am nearing the finish line.

<img src="https://github.com/forcequitOS/Avenis/blob/main/About%20Avenis.png?raw=true" alt="The Avenis > About page, shows app icon, version 1.0 development beta, 16 days of development time" width="35%">

### Features:
- Support for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS, and watchOS, seriously.
- Widgets for your Home Screen, Lock Screen, Apple Watch Face, Mac desktop, and watchOS Smart Stack, yes, actually.
- Somewhat properly scaled Retina icons for macOS (I see you, low res display users)
- Designed to take advantage of watchOS 10 UI design
- Full iOS 18 icon theming support (With tintable widgets too, don't think I forgot that now.)
- Displays your public and private IP addresses (Especially useful on watchOS, where it's almost impossible to get your IP address)
- Keyboard shortcuts wherever you need them
- No sideloading required on iPads! (As I distribute a Swift Playgrounds version of Netcheck at the same exact time I distribute the standard IPAs)
- Fast. Simple. Kinda configurable. What more could you want?

### Credits:

This project used to be called Netcheck until I realized a *verrry* similar app for Apple platforms already existed called NetCheck Connectivity, go check it out [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/netcheck-connectivity/id1570703771), this was entirely unintentional and I did not mean to copy, whoops.

On the topic of similar apps, I'm gonna go ahead and also recommend [IsThereNet](https://github.com/FuzzyIdeas/IsThereNet), pretty cool looking app!

For the record, I started developing Netcheck (now Avenis) around March to help me kill time and have just been struggling to complete it, but I promise I *will* do so someday soon!

<sub>The Avenis about screen is going right into my vault of "UI's I'm genuinely proud that I made", it looks so good.</sub>
