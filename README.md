### Credits:

This project used to be called Netcheck until I realized a *verrry* similar app for Apple platforms already existed called NetCheck Connectivity, go check it out [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/netcheck-connectivity/id1570703771), this was entirely unintentional and I did not mean to copy, whoops.

On the topic of similar apps, I'm gonna go ahead and also recommend [IsThereNet](https://github.com/FuzzyIdeas/IsThereNet), pretty cool looking app for macOS that monitors in the background!

Oh, and [r/SwiftUI](https://reddit.com/r/SwiftUI) for helping me get through some of the tougher conundrums during development, you guys rock.

For the record, I started developing Netcheck (now Avenis) around March to help me kill time and have just been struggling to complete it, but I promise I *will* do so someday soon!

### So what do I download?

Here's a chart.

### Future Plans:

After the... actual final release of Avenis, I have two main things planned for the future. "1.5", "The Widget Update", to bring some much needed enhancements to the widgets, which will be plentiful, but a bit lacking at launch, and "2.0", "The Background Update", possibly bringing background monitoring and a menu bar extra to the Mac app. No promises, though.

Also, the About screen ("Summit") is going to be modularized, since I want other apps to feel free to use it. This might happen before the official release, this might happen AFTER the official release, I just know it's going to happen, and probably before "The Widget Update".

<sub>The Avenis about screen, Summit, is going right into my vault of "UI's I'm genuinely proud that I made", it looks so good.</sub>
