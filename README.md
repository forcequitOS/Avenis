### Features:
- Support for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS, seriously.
- Widgets for your Home Screen, Lock Screen, Apple Watch Face, Mac desktop, and watchOS Smart Stack, yes, actually.
- Designed to take advantage of watchOS 10 UI design
- Full iOS 18 icon theming support
- Displays your public and private IP addresses (Genuinely very useful on specifically watchOS, where it's damn near impossible to get your private IP address.)
- Keyboard shortcuts on macOS
- Fast. Simple. What more could you want?
